Python Error Types
When we write code it is common that we make a typo or some other common error. If our code fails to run, the Python interpreter will display a message, containing feedback with information on where the problem occurs and the type of an error. It will also sometimes gives us suggestions on a possible fix. Understanding different types of errors in programming languages will help us to debug our code quickly and also it makes us better at what we do.

Let us see the most common error types one by one. First let us open our Python interactive shell. Go to your you computer terminal and write 'python'. The python interactive shell will be opened.

SyntaxError
"""
#Example 1: SyntaxError

asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print 'hello world'
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print 'hello world'
                      ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('hello world')?
>>>

#As you can see we made a syntax error because we forgot to enclose the string with parenthesis and 
# Python already suggests the solution. Let us fix it.

#The error was a SyntaxError. After the fix our code was executed without a hitch. Let see more error types.
