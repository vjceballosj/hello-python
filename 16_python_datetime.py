#Python has got datetime module to handle date and time.

import datetime
print(dir(datetime))
['MAXYEAR', 'MINYEAR', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'date', 'datetime', 'datetime_CAPI', 'sys', 'time', 'timedelta', 'timezone', 'tzinfo']

#With dir or help built-in commands it is possible to know the available functions in a certain module. As you can see, in the datetime module there are many functions, but we will focus on date, datetime, time and timedelta. Let se see them one by one.

#Getting datetime Information
from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()
print(now)                      # 2021-07-08 07:34:46.549883
day = now.day                   # 8
month = now.month               # 7
year = now.year                 # 2021
hour = now.hour                 # 7
minute = now.minute             # 38
second = now.second
timestamp = now.timestamp()
print(day, month, year, hour, minute)
print('timestamp', timestamp)
print(f'{day}/{month}/{year}, {hour}:{minute}')  # 8/7/2021, 7:38

#Timestamp or Unix timestamp is the number of seconds elapsed from 1st of January 1970 UTC.

#Formatting Date Output Using strftime
from datetime import datetime
new_year = datetime(2020, 1, 1)
print(new_year)      # 2020-01-01 00:00:00
day = new_year.day
month = new_year.month
year = new_year.year
hour = new_year.hour
minute = new_year.minute
second = new_year.second
print(day, month, year, hour, minute) #1 1 2020 0 0
print(f'{day}/{month}/{year}, {hour}:{minute}')  # 1/1/2020, 0:0
